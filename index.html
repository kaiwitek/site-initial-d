                    <p>
                        Initial D is a Japanese street racing manga series written and illustrated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuichi_Shigeno" target="_blank">Shuichi Shigeno</a>. It was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Young_Magazine" target="_blank">Weekly Young Magazine</a> from 1995 to 2013, with the chapters collected into 48 tankōbon volumes. The story focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the action is concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in cities or urban areas, and with the drifting racing style emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver and pioneer of drifting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiichi_Tsuchiya" target="_blank">Keiichi Tsuchiya</a> helped with editorial supervision. The story is centered on the prefecture of Gunma, more specifically on several mountains in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantō_region" target="_blank">Kantō region</a> and in their surrounding cities and towns. Although some of the names of the locations the characters race in have been fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on actual locations in Japan.

                            He acts as the delivery boy for his father's tofu business, driving his father's Toyota Sprinter Trueno (AE86) up to the top of the mountain every morning to deliver tofu to the hotels. After defeating Keisuke Takahashi in an impromptu battle he was nicknamed the "White Ghost of Akina" and began racing on his own, occasionally representing the Akina SpeedStars in battle. He was eventually invited to join Project D as their downhill ace.

                            An ex-bosozoku gang member, he was introduced to street racing by his brother Ryosuke and joined his team, the Akagi RedSuns, and soon became their second best driver in his Mazda RX-7 Type R.
